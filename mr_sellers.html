<p>"Mr. S", true identity kept hidden by both the Serial and Undisclosed podcasts, the man who found Hae's body while "taking a leak in Leakin Park". It is theorized that S had heard rumours of the body in the park, but this isn't strongly supported by much evidence. Additionally, he took two separate polygraph tests; he failed the first one, but passed on the second, which had different, more specific questions.

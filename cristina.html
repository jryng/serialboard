<p>M. Cristina Gutierrez, Adnan's first attourney who remained until the second trial in 2000. Her competence has been subject to debate as of recently, as she never used Asia's information despite being well aware of the letters, would frequently make absurd monetary requests to her clients, and just overall seemed a bit "off" in her cases after the new millenium. She was later disbarred due to a mishap with another client's money (around the time Adnan's second trial took place, actually), and due to her quickly declining health. She died in 2004 of multiple sclerosis.

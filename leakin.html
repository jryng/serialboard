<p>A park located near Woodlawn which is known for its natural beauty and its criminal activity, but mostly for the criminal activity. This infamous location was where Hae was buried, and whether or not Adnan and Jay were the ones who took the body there remains uncertain (though Adnan's cell phone logs have a call on the presumed day which pings the cell tower serving the area around the park, but again, these records aren't solid evidence for location info).</p>

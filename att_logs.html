<p>Call logs from Adnan's cell phone released by AT&T to the detectives. AT&T's original faxed document originally included 10 pages of logs, from January 11th to February 16th, but only January 12 and 13th are visible in this excerpt. Above the logs, a snippet from the fax cover reads: "Outgoing calls only are reliable for location status. Any incoming calls will NOT be considered reliable information for location." This was ignored and the logs were used as proof that Jay's story was the truth; an affidavit released in 2015, however, discredits this. Abraham Waranowitz, the RF engineer AT&T sent to "decipher" the logs, was "unaware" of the message in the fax cover, and further stated that he was used to having the raw data from the cell switches instead of relayed information such as that one.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calls made from Adnan&rsquo;s cell phone on January 12 and 13th, 1999. Above the logs, a snippet from the fax cover sheet AT&amp;T supplied alongside the original logs reads: &ldquo;<I>Outgoing calls only are reliable for location status. Any incoming calls will NOT be considered reliable information for location.&rdquo;</I></SPAN></DIV>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This warning was ignored and the information was used against Adnan anyway, until late 2015, when Abraham Waranowitz (back in 1999, an AT&amp;T engineer; he testified at trial regarding the data AT&amp;T handed over to the detectives) wrote an affidavit, in which he admits to not having known about the disclaimer.</SPAN></DIV>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite this, the phone records are still factual information, and can be used to verify details in Jay and Adnan&rsquo;s stories. </SPAN></DIV>

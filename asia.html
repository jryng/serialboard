<p>Asia McClain, a friend of Adnan's who admitted to having seen him at the Woodlawn library on January 13th, during the time where it is believed Hae's murder took place. She sent letters to him shortly after his arrest, both in March 1999. Adnan's attorney never bothered to call Asia and get her to talk at the trials, so this information remained largely ignored for years until the hearing in 2015. There was another hearing in 2012, but Asia refused to participate after a conversation with prosecuter Kevin Urick.

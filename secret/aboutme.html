<center><p>Congratulations! You're horrible at following instructions.</p></center>
<p>You're already here anyway, so I guess I'll tell you about this project. Strangely, work on it started back in early November - I made some generic assets
in case I got a Serial-related project, namely the vectorized logo and overall color pallet (if you haven't noticed, the paper on the corkboard has the same colour scheme as the Serial website, a type of cream yellow.)
It was just <i>that</i> predictable.</p>
<p>I've recently been trying out some new techniques for making my designs, mainly related to 3D. I use 3DS Max for my modeling purposes, Photoshop and Pixplant for texturing, 
Keyshot 7 for rendering and Coreldraw for everything in between. Seriously - it's one of the most useful pieces of software I've ever used, even if it's a bit antiquated and buggy at times.
I use it for compositing, vector art, even building web pages (see index)!</p>
<p>That's about it for info about this project. You've found <b> one </b> of <b> two </b> secrets on the main page. Try to find the rest!</p>

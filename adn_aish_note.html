<p>A note, found in Adnan’s room along with some pictures of him and Hae from prom, and some old cards. On one side, a letter from Hae where she breaks up with Adnan. On the other side, Adnan and Aisha make fun of just about everything - but that’s not all. On the header, in pen, is written “I’m going to kill” - and in the original note, Adnan was writing in pen, and Aisha in pencil.</p>
<br><br>
<p>Aisha later admitted to not having noticed until seeing the letter again during the trial, which raises some suspicions.

<p>Hae's car, which had disappeared sometime after her murder. It's a 1998 Nissan Sentra SXS, and had a variety of interesting little tidbits of evidence still inside, including a note from Hae to her then-new-boyfriend, Don; a map, with the page displaying Baltimore and the Leakin Park area ripped out (and, strangely, the map had half of Adnan's left palm print on the cover, but this isn't exactly relevant - lots of people rode in Hae's car), etc.

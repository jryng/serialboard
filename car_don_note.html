<p>A note from Hae addressed to Don, her then boyfriend. In it, she apologizes for not being able to stick around longer (presumably, the letter is from January 13th) due to having to go to a wrestling match at another high school, and tells him that "the interview was great" (referring to an interview she made to local TV channel 36, where she talked about her participation in sports).</p>
